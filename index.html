                <p class="index-body-text">Established in 2014, Tribe Robotics FRC 4123, brings together professional
                    mentors with enthusiastic and passionate students from St. John Bosco High School located in
                    Bellflower,
                    CA. Our mission is to inspire students to explore, experience, and appreciate science, technology,
                    engineering, math and design through hands-on participation in FIRST® Robotics competition (FRC).
                    Our
                    motto, “student built, mentor approved” is exactly how our team operates: it is up to the students
                    to
                    design and build our robot—mentors are there to oversee and approve, not build.</p>
                <p class="index-body-text">We view our team to be another sport at SJB: a sort of varsity, “Sport of the
                    Mind”. Donald E. Bossi, FIRST® President, describes robotics as a sport for the 21st century saying,
                    “The skills students can learn, including teamwork, collaboration and problem solving, are the same
                    as
                    those learned in other sports. But, unlike most sports, robotics provides all students – no matter
                    their
                    background or physical ability – the opportunity to become a STEM (science, technology, engineering,
                    and
                    math) professional.”</p>
                <p class="index-body-text">Our team members’ experience is as close to “real world” engineering as a
                    student
                    can get. Team members receive hands-on experience in areas of mechanical engineering, CAD design,
                    programming, electrical engineering, project management, leadership and strategic thinking skills as
                    well as the business side of running a team: fundraising, inventory control, public relations and
                    finance. </p>
                <p class="index-body-text">Former team members of Tribe Robotics currently attend the Naval Academy,
                    Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), University of San Diego (USD), Gonzaga, University of
                    Southern California (USC), UC Irvine and CSU Long Beach. Our team’s average GPA is 3.8/4.0.</p>
